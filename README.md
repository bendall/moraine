#Moraine

Moraine is a set of useful patches for prototyping user interfaces within Quartz Composer. Although most patches will be free from dependencies, some require Facebook's Quartz Composer:

##Patches Included:

* **Swipe Counter:** counts swipes across a layer. Can be used to page through a set number of pages, with a specified page width (ex. swiping through a photo in a photo gallery).
* **Nexus 5:** Renders a Nexus 5 device on the viewer. Connect a render in image patch with 1080x1920px dimensions.
* **Tap Cursor:** Renders a tap cursor on the screen. You can pair this with Origami's cursor control to hide OSX's mouse cursor.
* **Absolute Value:** calculates the absolute value of an input value.


##Installation:
