Moraine is a set of useful patches for prototyping user interfaces within Quartz Composer. Although most patches will be free from dependencies, some require Facebook's Quartz Composer:

##Patches Included:

* **Hit Area:** improved performance (fps) while using multiple hit area patches.
* **Nexus 5:** Renders a Nexus 5 device on the viewer. Connect a render in image patch with 1080x1920px dimensions.
* **Tap Cursor:** Renders a tap cursor on the screen. You can pair this with Origami's cursor control to hide OSX's mouse cursor.
* **Absolute Value:** calculates the absolute value :)
