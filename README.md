#Moraine

Moraine is a set of useful patches for prototyping user interfaces with Quartz Composer and Facebook's Origami plugin: https://facebook.github.io/origami/


##Patches Included:

* **Pager:** page through a set number of pages (ex. carousel, or tabs). Supports the user swiping very fast through the image, or very slowly peeking/paging through the image. Count value comes in handy for additional logic.
* **Pinch to Zoom:** multi-touch pinch gesture with scale output value (ex. pinch to scale an image). Includes rotation if the user forces it (will snap back on release).
* **Delay v2**: delay patch made out of stock Quartz Composer patches. Does not require Facebook Origami.


##Installation:

Download the repo and copy the 'Moraine' folder into your Library > Graphics > Quartz Composer Patches folder.

Facebook's Origami plugin must be installed for the Pager and Pinch to Zoom patches.
